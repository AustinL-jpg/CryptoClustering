# CryptoClustering

In this assignment we are tasked with fining the best k value using our dataframe. 

Using python and our knowlede of unsupervised learning were are trying to predict what timeframe the crypto market is affected by. 

Finding the best k value for the original scaled data. 

Using the k-means model we need to find the best value for k. By setting the k values from 1-11 and putting them into a for loop and fitting them to the data. 
With that we then are tasked with creating the elbow curve and plotting it using the .hvplot method.
